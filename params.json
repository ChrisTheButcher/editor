{"name":"Editor","tagline":"A different wysiwyg editor specially designed for content-writers","body":"WYSIWYG editor\r\n======\r\n####0.0.1 PRE ALPHA\r\n\r\nA somewhat different wysiwyg editor specially designed for content-writers.\r\nWe don't want crappy HTML to be generated so we use our own HTML engine and overwrite all default actions.\r\nWe also want the content-writer (without any knowledge of HTML) to be able to see the difference between for example a bold tag and a h3 tag.\r\n\r\n**Please note that this editor is NOT ready for production!!!**\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to build\r\n============\r\n\r\nI use `grunt` and `nodeJS` to build the entire project, both software runs on Windows, Mac Osx and Linux.\r\nThe first thing you should do is set-up NodeJS which can be done by going to: http://nodejs.org/ and press the 'install' button (make sure that node is in your PATH variable so it can be accessed globally).\r\n\r\nThe next step is to get the source-code from GitHub you can either use the GIT command-line tools, download the repository as a ZIP file or use the GitHub client app (which can be downloaded here: https://mac.github.com/ or here: https://windows.github.com/).\r\n\r\nIf you're done open the terminal or MS-DOS with admin priviliges, then run the following commands:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install -g grunt\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will install the grunt build-system.\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will install all nodeJS dependencies.\r\n\r\n```\r\ngrunt\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will minify all javascript and css files to the /build directory.\r\n\r\n```\r\nnode app\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will create a new static-file webserver which can be used to view the editor (a webserver is needed since I use ajax in the code). The default port is `8080` which can be changed in the `/app.js` file.\r\n\r\nGo to http://localhost:8080 in your browser and voila!\r\nPlease note that on every change you should run `grunt` again!\r\n","google":"UA-39333802-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
